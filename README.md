# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
Implementation of data structures and algorithms in C#


This program was developed during my one semester course in Data Structures and Algorithms. It was built with Microsoft Visual Studio 2012. It provides a GUI implementation of sorting and searching algorithms, stacks, queues and binary tree. This program will be relevant to computer science students around the world who want to know how data structures and algorithms are implemented using programming logic in C#
